Dataset Name: PadChest Chest X-rays (Sample)

Source:
- Official sample from the PadChest dataset, hosted on Kaggle[](https://www.kaggle.com/raddar/padchest-chest-xrays-sample)
- Original full dataset from BIMCV (Medical Imaging Bank of the Valencia Region) at http://bimcv.cipf.es/bimcv-projects/padchest/

Overview:
- This is a sample subset of the PadChest dataset, containing high-resolution, anonymized chest X-ray images with multi-label annotations for various pathologies (e.g., pneumonia, tumors, heart conditions). The labels are derived from radiological reports, including details like view position and patient demographics (aggregated, no identifiers).

Purpose:
- Ideal for training and testing AI models for automated chest X-ray interpretation and disease detection. In Nynava, it can support insights on respiratory and thoracic health from uploaded scans, enhancing diagnostic tools.

- CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (free for non-commercial research use; attribution required, share-alike, no commercial derivatives). Always cite the BIMCV source in publications.

Technical Details:
- Size: Sample is approximately 1-2 GB (full dataset is ~100k studies, but sample is smaller for ease)
- Number of Images: Around 1,000-5,000 X-rays in the sample (exact varies by download version)
- Format: DICOM or PNG images with CSV labels for pathologies and reports

Notes:
- Fully anonymizedâ€”no personal identifiable information; suitable for AI research under ethical guidelines.
- The sample is a representative subset of the full ~160,000 image dataset; for more data, request access to the complete PadChest via the official site.
- Useful for multi-label classification AI; consider combining with datasets like ChestX-ray14 for better model accuracy.
